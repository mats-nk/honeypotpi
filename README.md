==========

Script for turning a Raspberry Pi into a Honey Pot Pi

To install, copy these scripts to your Raspberry Pi and execute:

`chmod +x ./*.sh`

`./honeypotcreate.sh`

To start the XRDP honeypot run the following command:

`./honeypotstart.sh`

(or the actual xrdp command)

`sudo /etc/xrdp/xrdp.sh start`

The login of failed attempts will be located at:

`/var/log/xrdp.log`

You can filter for failed logins in a very crude manner:

`./honeypotloggedcredentials.sh`

(or the actual xrdp command)

`sudo cat /var/log/xrdp.log | grep USER:`

...and check the raw log by typing:

`./honeypotrawlog.sh`

(or the actual xrdp command)

`sudo cat /var/log/xrdp.log`

You can also check your Pi's temperature by typing:

`./pitemp.sh`

If you would like to have some live monitoring, which shows the logged credentials and the current date every 30 seconds, type:

`./honeypotmonitor.sh`

The monitor is very useful if you enter LXDE / windowed mode by typing:

`startx`

...then you can open a terminal window and run the honeypotmonitor.sh on one desktop,

...and run etherape on another desktop by typing into a new terminal window:

`sudo etherape`

...and run wireshark on another desktop by typing into a new terminal window:

`sudo wireshark`

Then CTRL - ALT - left arrow or right arrow will switch desktops and you can keep an eye on your HoneyPotPi
